# CSS Structure (FLOCSS-ish)

- `styles/foundation/`: variables & base reset
- `styles/layout/`: (reserved) layout wrappers/grids
- `styles/object/component/`: reusable components (btn, card)
- `styles/object/project/`: project-specific legacy styles (migrated from the old `style.css`) — split further as you iterate
- `styles/object/utility/`: helpers (spacing, text utilities) — add as needed

Entry point: `src/styles/main.css`
